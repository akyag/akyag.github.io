        <p>
          Back in 2012, I created an Android ROM for the HTC Explorer that was
          based on the HTC Pico Europe 1.28.401.1 stock ROM. Now it's outdated,
          but I would like to mention it here as it was my first step in Android
          customization. The original thread with all the details is located at
          the XDA Forum at the link mentioned below. Feel free to check it out.

          Back in the day, I served more than 20,000 downloads of NExtGen, and
          it blew my mind that so many people used my ROM. I will always be
          thankful for the overwhelming support. Thank you!!!
